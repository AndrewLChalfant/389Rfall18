## Assignment 10 Writeup

### Part 1 (70 Pts)
I started by trying to manually connecting to the server and just trying random options to see what the formatting was like. I somehow managed to get the flag by accident (I guess just luck), early on in the project before I began to write my script.

I took a screenshot trying to figure out how I got to the key, I wasn't able to reproduce until I had finished my script. 

Upon starting the script I first made sure my connection was setup correctly so I could pass in my sample message and receive a legit message from the server. I used the sockets module from earlier projects and\ printed the output I was receiving to debug. Once I completed that, I created payloads with custom padding to try and find the right length given the secret length. A lot of this was trial and error until I finally got the output I was looking for. 

I configured my output to only show once I hadn't seen the "Hmm" message which appeared for unsuccesful input. Running the script will print out the correct flag: CMSC389R-{i_still_put_the_M_between_the_DV}


### Part 2 (30 Pts)
1.	To generate a key: 	"gpg --gen-key"
2.	To import a key: 	"gpg --import pgassignment.key"
3.	To encode a key:	"gpg --output message.private encrypt" and then enter information from listing output of step 2 (gpg --list-keys)
