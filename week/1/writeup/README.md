### Part 2 (75 pts)
I have an ethical obligation to share what I have learned. Keeping this information to myself is a conscious decision that could lead to preventable death or injury. If I were put in this situation I would first tell my boss. Going to the public straight away would most likely get you fired and the company should deserve the chance to address the issue. If my job is to audit and report security issues with the ECU firmware, I (hopefully) won't be getting into any trouble by reporting this issue to my boss.

If I found that my boss does not address my concerns, attempted to cover up the issue, or refused to postpone the ECU's release, going public as an anonymous source would distribute this information while protecting my job. I feel that I have a greater duty to society to report this problem, especially since it is large enough that it could cause death.  

I'm absolutely responsible for any harm that results. Choosing to do nothing is still a conscious decision, even though it might seem like the lack of one. I wouldn't feel responsible if I told my boss or escalated the issue further, but if I kept the issue secret I'd be betraying my obligation as a good moral citizen.
